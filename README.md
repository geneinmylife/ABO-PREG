# ABO-PREG

This repository contains code for reproducing the Mendelian randomization examined in ' The effect of levels of BGAT protein on pregnancy related outcomesï¼ša Mendelian randomization study'. In this study, we estimated the effect of the protein level of Histo-Blood Group ABO System Transferase (BGAT) on ten pregnancy related outcomes using genetic instruments respectively from deCODE, INTERVAL and Fenland. Our study highlighted BGAT as a putative causal protein for venous complications and haemorrhoids in pregnancy, which requires further investigation to validate it as a potential drug target.
